(Sonny Burke and Paul Francis Webster)


Introdução: Dm7 F9 G7 Dm5-/7 C A7 Dm7 G#7 G7 

     C         A#       C         C#9 
I'm feelin' mighty lonesome, haven't slept a wink 
  C              A#         C         C9 
I walk the floor and watch the door, in between I drink 
   F9     Fm       Fm6        C  C#9  C  A7 
Black coffee love's a hand-me-down broom 
     Dm7       F9     G7   Dm5-/7   C  A7  Dm7 G#7 G7 
I'll never know a Sunday in this weekday room 
  C            A#      C        C#9 
I'm talkin to the shadow one o'clock till four 
 C             A#        C       C9 
And Lord, how slow the moments go when all I do is pour 
 F9        Fm        Fm6         C    C#9  C  A7 
Black coffee  since the blues caught my eye 
 Dm7            F9    G7   Dm5-/7   C  B7  A#7 A7 G#7 G7 C 
I'm hangin' out on Monday my Sunday dreams to dry 
Bridge 
C#9 Fm     Fm7         C 
Now man is born to come alovin' 
  Fm          Fm7 A#dim  C 
And a woman's born to weep and fret 
      G#7          C# 
To stay at home and tend her oven 
  G#7    A#dim     G#7     G7      G#dim   G7 
And drown her past regrets in coffee and cigarettes 
   C          A#      C          C#9 
I'm moonin' all the mornin', moanin' all the night 
 C          A#          C           C9 
And in between it's nicotine and not much heart to fight 
   F9     Fm         Fm6           C    C#9  C   
Black coffee  feelin' low as the ground 
     E7      A#7   A7        F9    Dm5-/7   G7 
It's drivin' me crazy, this waitin' for my baby 
G#dim    G7  Dm5-/7  C  A7 Dm7  G7  G#dim    C A7  Dm7 G#7 G7 C  
'Til he come   around,     til he come around 

  Dm7    F9     G7
