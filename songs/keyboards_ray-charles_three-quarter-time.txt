Ray Charles - Three Quarter Time (Keyboard chords)

This song is on Ray Charles' country album "Wish You were Here Tonight" 
circa 1982 or 1983.  I picked it up around 1984.  It's really a good country  
song -- try to check it out. 
 
I worked this song out off the record, so it's all my own work and may not  
be perfectly accurate, but it works for me.  Hope it does for you, too.
