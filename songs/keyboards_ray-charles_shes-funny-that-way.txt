Ray Charles - She's Funny That Way (Keyboard chords)
(Richard A. Whiting and Neil Moret)



    C    C9  C   C9           B7 
I'm not much to look at, I'm nothing to see 
    C7M/9                     Em5-/7   A7      
I'm just glad I'm living, I'm happy to be 
F            F6        F7M        Fm6 
I've got a woman who's crazy 'bout me  
C    Am        F9   G7 
She's funny that way 
    C    C9  C  C9       B7 
I can't save a dollar, I ain't worth a cent 
C7M  C7M/9  Am           Em5-/7    A7      
She'd never holler, she'd live in a tent 
F         F6     F7M        Fm6 
I've got a woman, crazy for me  
C     F9   G7/13  C 
She's funny that way 
Bridge 
G7         G#dim      G7      Dm5-/7      C       Am 
Though I know she'd work and slave for me every day 
D7      D#dim     D7    Dm5-/7   F D#dim  G7 
She'd be so much better off if I went away 
      C    C9  C   C9       B7 
But why should I leave her? Why should I go 
C7M     C7M/9 Am         Em5-/7    A7 
She'd be unhappy    without me, I know 
F           F6         F7M       Fm6 
I've got a woman who's crazy for me  
C     F9   G7/13  C 
She's funny that way 

  C      C9     B7     C7M/9
