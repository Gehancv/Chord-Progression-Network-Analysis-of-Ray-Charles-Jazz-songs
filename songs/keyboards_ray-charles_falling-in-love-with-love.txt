Introdução: C G7 

    C                C5-/7            
I weave with brightly colored strings 
    C             C5-/7 
To keep my mind off other things 
    G4/7             Dm7 
So, ladies, let your fingers dance 
    G4/7               Dm7   G7 
And keep your hands out of romance 
       C       A7/9-         Dm7     G7 
Lovely witches,      let the stitches 
          Dm7     G7        C 
Keep your fingers under control 
       Am           Dm        Dm7   G7     C      
Cut the thread, but leave the whole heart whole 
G7/9 
Merrry maids can sew and sleep 
G7              Dm7  D#m7     G7   
Wives can only     sew and weep 
  C       C7M      C6  C           G4/7     G7    Dm7 G7 
Falling in love with love is falling for make-believe 
G4/7        G7        G4/7 
Falling in love with love 
   G7          C7M  C6 C7M C6 
Is playing the fool 
C7M       C6      C7M   C6    E4/7   E7 G6 E7 
Caring too much is such a juvenile fancy 
Adim        Am        Dm    D7          Dm7    G7 
Learning to trust is just por children in school 
C        C7M      C6         C 
I fell in love with love one night 
       G4/7        G7  Dm7 G7 
When the moon was full 
G4/7     G7        G4/7 G7    C7M    C6 C7M C6  
I was unwise with eyes    unable to see 
C7M       C6      C7M       C6     E4/7   E7 A7M 
I fell in love with love with love ever  lasting

I was unwise with eyes    unable to see

I fell in love with love with love ever  lasting
