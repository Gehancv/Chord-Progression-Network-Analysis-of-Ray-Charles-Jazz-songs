Ray Charles - A Song For You (Keyboard chords)
(Leon Russell)


Introdução: Am Am7+ Am7  Am6 Am7 Am7+ Am E7/9- 

     Am           Am7+         Am7           Am6       
I've been so many places in my life and time 
     C                           Fm5-/7 
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme 
      F                Em7        
I've acted out my life in stages 
              Dm7            Em7 
With ten thousand people watching  
          Dm7       Em7      F                     C    E7 
But we're alone now and I'm singin' this song for you 
    Am       Am7+          Am7         Am6       
I know your image of me is what I hope to be 
      C                       Fm5-/7 
I've treated you unkindly but baby can't you see 
        F                      Em7 
There's no one more important to me    
  Dm7                     Em7 
Baby can't you please see through me, 
Dm7            Em7                F                C     E7 
'Cause we're alone now and I'm singin' this song for you 
     Am7               E7                C          F#m5-/7 
You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholdin' nothin' 
      F          G6               C 
You came out in front and I was hiding 
     Em7        Am7    E7  
But now I'm so much better  
      C                       F#m5-/7 
And if my words don't come together 
                F      Em7    Dm7        G7 
Listen to the melody 'cause my love's in there,  hiding 
 Am              Am7+             Am7            Am6   
I love you in a place where there's no space or time 
   C              Fm#5-/7            
I love you for my life, you are a friend of mine 
    F       Em7             Dm7              Em7 
And when my life is over, remember when we were together 
   Dm7     Em7            F            C       E7            
We were alone and I was singin' this song for you 
     Am7               E7                C          F#m5-/7 
You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholdin' nothin' 
      F          G6               C 
You came out in front and I was hiding 
     Em7        Am7    E7  
But now I'm so much better  
      C                       F#m5-/7 
And if my words don't come together 
                F      Em7    Dm7        G7 
Listen to the melody 'cause my love's in there,  hiding 
 Am              Am7+             Am7            Am6   
I love you in a place where there's no space or time 
   C              Fm#5-/7            
I love you for my life, you are a friend of mine 
    F       Em7             Dm7              Em7 
And when my life is over, remember when we were together 
   Dm7     Em7            F            C       E7            
We were alone and I was singin' this song for you 
   Dm7                   Em7        F      G#7           G7      C7M   
We were alone and I was singin' this song, singin' this song for you 

  Am     Am7+   Am7    Am6    E7/9-  C
