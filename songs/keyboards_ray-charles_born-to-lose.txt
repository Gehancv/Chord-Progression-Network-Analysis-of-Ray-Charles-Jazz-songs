Ray Charles - Born to lose (Keyboard chords)

(C) Born to lose, I've (F) lived my life in (C) vain, 
Ev'ry (G) dream has only brought me (C) pain, 
All my life I've (F) always been so (C) blue, 
Born to lose, and (G) now I'm losing (C) you, 
 
Born to lose, it (F) seems so hard to (C) bear, 
how I (G) long to always have you (C) near, 
You've grown tired, and (F) now you say we're (C) through, 
Born to lose, and (G) now I'm losing (C) you, 
 
riff 
 
Born to lose, my (F) every hope is (C) gone, 
It's so (G) hard to face that empty (C) dawn, 
You were all the (F) happiness I (C) knew, 
Born to lose and (G) now I'm losing (C) you, 
 
There is no use to (F) dream of happi-(C)-ness, 
All I (G) see is only lonely-(C)-ness, 
All my life, I've (F) always been so (C) blue, 
Born to lose, and (G) now I'm losing (C) you, 
 
Tag:
