 C   G7    C    F9  C   C7M    D#dim  G7     F9  G7 
Some enchanted evening    you may see a stranger 
G7   Dm5-/7     C    F9 C7    Gdim C7  F7M    F6 
You may see a stranger     across a crowded room 
 Am      G7     G#dim     Am  D7 
And somehow you know, you know even then 
  F9        Dm5-/7     G7 F9   G7  G#dim Dm5-/7  C Am D7M G7 
That somewhere you'll see  her  again and  again 
C    G7      C  F9  C   C7M   D#dim  G7     F9  G7 
Some enchanted evening,   someone may be laughing 
G7   Dm5-/7      C    F9 C7 Gdim   C7  F7M    F6 
You may hear her laughing   across a crowded room 
  Am        G7       G#dim         Am  D7 
And night after night, as strange as it seems 
  F9          Dm5-/7   G7  F9   G7  G#dim   Dm5-/7 C  F9 C C7 
The sound of her  laughter   will sing in your dreams 
F9     Am            G#dim    G7      C 
Who can explain it, who can tell you why 
F9          C      D7   Dm5-/7   G  F9  Gdim   G7 
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try 
 C    G7    C   F9  C   C7M   D#dim      G7      F9  G7 
Some enchanted evening,   when you find your true love 
 G7     Dm5-/7   C    F9 C7       Gdim   C7 F7M    F6 
When you feel her call     you across a crowded room 
     Am         G     G#dim         Am    D7 
Then fly to her side and make her your own 
    F9         Dm5-/7    G7 F9   G7  G#dim Dm5-/7  C F9 C C7 
Or all through your life you may dream all   alone 
 F9        Am        G#dim             C 
Once you have found her, never let her go 
F9       Am      Dm  Dm7/G  Dm5-/7 Fm6 C 
Once you have found her, never let her go 

  C      G7     F9     C7M    D#dim
