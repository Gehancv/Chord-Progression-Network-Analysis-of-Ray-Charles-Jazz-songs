(Howard Deitz and Arthur Schwartz)


Intro: Am Am6 Bm7 E7  Am Am6 Bm7 E7 

  Am Am6    Bm7   E7  Am   Am6     Bm7 E7 
Alone       together,        beyond  the crowd 
  Am Am6     Em5-/7 A7/9- Dm      Dm7+      Dm7 Dm7/C 
Above      the world,         we're not too proud 
   Dm7/13    E7                A#7       E7              A7M 
To cling together  we're strong as long as we're together 
  Am Am6    Bm7  E7 Am    Am6     Bm7   E7 
Alone      together,       the blinding rain 
  Am Am6     Em5-/7 A7/9- Dm      Dm7+ Dm7 Dm7/C 
The starless night,     we're not in vain 
   Dm7/13    E7           A#7              E7       A     Bm E7 A 
For we're together, and what is there to fear together 
Bridge 
    Em5-/7 A7/9-                    Dm7 
Our love       is as deep as the sea 
    A#    E7                  C      C/B     E7          
Our love   is as great as a love can  be 
   Am Am6       Bm7    E7 Am     Am6    Bm7   E7 
And we      can weather        the great unknown 
Dm             E7         A 
If we're alone together 

  Am     Am6    Bm7    E7
