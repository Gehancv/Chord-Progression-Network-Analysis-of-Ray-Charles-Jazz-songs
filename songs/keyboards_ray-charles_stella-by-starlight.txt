C   Cdim  Adim   D7    Dm7 G7 
The song    a robin sings

Through years  of endless springs 
Fdim C      Am     Em        Cdim 
The murmur of a brook at eventide 
  G          Cdim       Dm7         E7 
That ripples by a nook where two lovers hide

A great   symphonic theme

That's Stella by starlight  and not a dream 
   Cdim  Adim       Gm   A7 
My heart    and I agree 
         Fm7  Fm5-/7           C   
She's ev'rything   on earth to me
