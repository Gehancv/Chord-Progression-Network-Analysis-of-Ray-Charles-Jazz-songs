Verse 1:
        F9              A#9
        You know my baby     she won't let me in 
        F9                    A#9
        I've got a few pennies     I'm gonna buy myself a bottle of gin
        F                  A7           Dm      F7/C  A#     Bdim7
        And then I'm gonna call my buddy     on the telephone and say
        A#6/C         F     1: C             F
        (Let's go get stoned)         Now listen

Verse 2:

        You know I work so hard all the day long
        Everything I try to do   seem to always turn out wrong
        That's why I wanna stop by   on my way home and say
        (Let's go get stoned)   Now let me tell you one more thing

repeat chorus

Bridge:
        A#7           Dm
        Ain't no harm     to have a little taste
        A#7                      F7
        But don't lose your cool     and start messing up the man's place
        A#7           Dm
        Ain't no harm     to take a little nip
        A#7                     G7               C7
        But don't you fall down     and bust your lip  mmm, no, no

repeat chorus to fade:
        3: I think everybody wants to come on and go with me
        4: I'm gonna tell you one more time what I'm gonna do
        5: I think you ought to say it one more time
