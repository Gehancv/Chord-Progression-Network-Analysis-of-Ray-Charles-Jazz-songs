Ray Charles - Ellie, My Love (Keyboard chords)
(Keisuke Kuwata)

                   C                                                       Em         
There were times I left your heart in pain, time again I've turned and walked away 
       C7                                     F 
I get to where I'm going just to find 
               Dm7             G7                    C             Am 
Won't be happy in this world if you're not by my side 
    F          G7    C 
Ellie, my love so sweet 
 
                 C                                            Em                                     
My heart told me to break away now I'm out here far away 
       C7                                          F 
Wish that I could hold you in the night 
               Dm7              G7                    C              Am 
Then I'd wake up to a morning that is warm and bright 
    F          G7    C 
Ellie, my love so sweet 
 
    Dm7                            G7         Em7                         Am7 
Smile for me, won't you, baby,  forever you'll be on my mind 
    Dm7                            G7               Em7                            Am7 
Drink with me won't you baby, we're gonna make it right this time 
F                       G7                      Em7                    A7 
There's no one else like you, anything you want, I'll do

Ellie, my love so sweet

My heart told me to break away now I'm out here far away 
       C7                                          F 
Wish that I could hold you in the night
