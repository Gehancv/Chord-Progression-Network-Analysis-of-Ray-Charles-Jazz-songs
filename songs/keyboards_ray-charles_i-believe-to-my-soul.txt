Ray Charles - I Believe To My Soul (Keyboard chords)

Am 
One of these days 
And it won't be long 
Am 
You're gonna look for me 
              Dm 
And I'll be gone' 
Cause I believe 
(I believe, yes I believe) 
                       Am 
I say I believe right now 
(I believe, yes I believe) 
                     F     E 
Well I believe to my soul now 
You're tryin' 
To make a fool of me 
Am 
(I believe it, I believe it) 

Am 
Well you're goin' 'round here 
With your head so hard 
Am 
I think 
I'm gonna have to use my rod 
                     Dm 
'Cause I believe 
(I believe, yes I believe) 
                        Am 
I say I believe right now 
(I believe, yes I believe) 
                      F     E 
Well I believe to my soul now 
You're tryin' 
To make a fool of me 
Am 
(I believe it, I believe it) 

Am 
Last night 
You were dreaming 
And I heard you say 
Am 
"Oh, Johnny" 
When you know my name is Ray 
That's why 
                     Dm 
I believe right now 
(I believe, yes I believe) 
                       Am 
I say I believe right now 
(I believe, yes I believe) 
                      F     E 
Well I believe to my soul now 
You're tryin' 
To make a fool of me 
Am 
(I believe it) 

  Am     Dm     F      E
