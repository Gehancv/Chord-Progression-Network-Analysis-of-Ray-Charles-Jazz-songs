       Am7           D7 
What a day this has been 
        G   G7M      Em 
What a rare mood I'm in 
          Am7        Am5-/7  D7  G   G7M G7/13  G7 
Why, it's almost like being in love

There's a smile on my face 
         G    G7M    Em

Bridge 
       F#m7         B7           E  E7 
All the mu - sic of life seems to be 
 Em7                A7         D7 
Like a bell that is ringing for me 
             Am7         D7 
And from the way that I feel 
           G    G7M      Em 
When that bell starts to peel 
         Am7        D7 
I would swear I was falling 
         G   G7     Em 
I could swear I was falling 
     Am7  Am7/D    Am5-/7      D7 G 
It's amost     like  being    in love
