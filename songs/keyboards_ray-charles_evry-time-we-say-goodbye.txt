Ray Charles - Ev'ry Time We Say Goodbye (Keyboard chords)
(Cole Porter)

 
Introdução: C Am C Am C Am C Am 

C    Am      C    Am   Dm7      G7 
Ev'ry time we say goodbye, I die a little 
C     G7  D#  G7    C  C7      Fm 
Ev'ry time we say goodbye, I wonder why a little 
C   D#dim   Fm6  G7     Gm    C7      F 
Why the gods above me, who must be in the know 
Fm          C7/13-   D#dim        G7 
Think so little of me they allow you to go 
C      Am    C      Am      C  Am    D7     G7 
When you're near there's such an air of spring about it 
C      G7  D#  G7   C    C7     F     Fm 
I can hear a lark somewhere begin to sing about it 
C       D#dim      Fm   G7 
There's no love song finer 
    C7       F        Fm 
But how strange the change from major to minor  
C     A7  D7     F  G7     C 
Ev'ry time    we say goodbye
