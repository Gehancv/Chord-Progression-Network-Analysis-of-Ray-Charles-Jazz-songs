(Instrumental break) 
I might add the solo in time. For the time being,  
I'd suggest playing between your Em and Am pentatonic  
scales for a nice blues jazz solo. 

G                        Cdim7   
  Baby, won't you let me hold your hand 
G                           Cdim7 
   I want to squeeze you as tight as I can 
G                          Cdim7 
   Baby, don't you need my by your side 
G                     Cdim7 
   To protect you and be your guide 
G                  Cdim7 
   Baby, I'm so in love with you 
G                      Cdim7 
   I'd do anything you tell me to 

                 G       
Now, ain't that love 
(ain't that love) 
           D   
Ain't that love 
(ain't that love) 
           G   G/B      C7         Cdim7 
C'mon now, ain't that love, now 
(oh, oh, oh, oh) 
           G     Em7 A7    
Ain't that love, baby that I feel
