It won't be easy you'll think it strange when I try to explain how I fee 
                                 C              
That I still need your love after all that I've done 
            Am/C                         D7    
You won't believe me all you will see is a girl you once knew 
Dm/C                               G7   D7                       G7  C 
Although she is dressed up to the nines at sixes and sevens with you

I had to let it happen, I had to change couldn't stay all my life down that hill 
        Dm/C                      C                          Am/C 
Looking out of the window, staying out of the sun so I chose freedom 
                          D7 
Running 'round trying everything  
                              G7    D7                       C 
New but nothing impressed me at all   I never expected it to 
                                                                        G7 
Don't cry for me Argentina the truth is I never left you all through my wild days 
         Am                   C                      F7M   Am7 C 
My mad existence I kept my promise don't keep you distance 
                            F/C                       Dm/C 
And as for fortune, and as for fame I never invited them in 
            G7                         C                                      
Though it seemed to the world they were all I desired,  
             Am/C                                      D7 
They were illusions, they're not the solutions they promised to be 
  Dm/C                     G/B     D7                        G7 
The answer was here all the time I love you and hope you love me 
F7M 
Have I said too much 
                                        G7 
There's nothing more I can think of to say to you 
  F7M                                                    G7       C 
But all you have to do is look at me to know that every word is true  
                                                                         G7 
Don't cry for me Argentina the truth is I never left you all through my wild days 
        Am                    C                    F7M    Am7 C 
My mad existence I kept my promise don't keep you distance 

  C      F/C    G/C    Am/C   D7     Dm/C 
                              
                              
                              
                              
                              


  G7     Am     F7M    Am7    G/B
