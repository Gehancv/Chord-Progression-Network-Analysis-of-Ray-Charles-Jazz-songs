Ray Charles - Carry Me Back To Old Virginny (Keyboard chords)
(James A. Bland)



Intro: C7 

Carry me back   to old Virginny. 
F        A    A#         Bo 
There's where the cotton and corn and taters grow. 
C/F               A-          G              C    
That's where the birds warble sweet in the spring-time. 
F                 A     A#                 Bo  
That's where this heart of mine, longs to go. 
C/F                D        G     C        F 

Carry me back   to old Virginny, 
F        A    A#         Bo 
There let me live till I wither and decay. 
C/F          A-            G            C    
Long by the old Dismal Swamp have I wandered, 
F           A     A#                 Bo  
That's where this life of mine will pass away. 
C/F      D        G       C         F 


Mother and father   have gone before me, 
F          A      A#             Bo 
Soon we will meet on that bright and golden shore. 
C/F          A-            G                C    
There we'll be happy   and free from all sorrow, 
F              A     A#                   Bo  
And there we'll meet, and part no more. 
C/F                D      G    C  F 

***Now I know the meaning of the phrase "Virginia is for lovers." I've fallen head  
over heels for the state.***
