Ray Charles - Born To Be Blue (Keyboard chords)
(Bob Wells and Mel Tormé)

 

C          D#9   Fm5-/7       C  
Some folks were meant to live in clover 
   C      D#9        Dm7   G7  
But they are such a chosen few  
   C          Fm     C         C6   Fm5-/7  
And clover, being green, is something I've never seen 
     C   Fm7        G9    G7  
'Cause I was born to be blue 
   C      D#9   Fm5-/7  C  
When there's a yellow moon above me 
   C      D#9           Dm7   G7  
They say that moon beams I should view 
 C            Fm     C       C6      Fm5-/7  
But moon beams, being gold, are something I can't behold 
    C     Dm7   G7     C  
'Cause I was born to be blue  
Bridge  
Dm7    G7       Dm7            G7  
When I met you, the world was bright and sunny  
Dm7    G9       G7      C  
When you left, the curtain fell 
A7        D7            A7       D7  
I want to laugh, but nothing strikes me funny 
D7          Dm7     G9  Dm7 G7  
Now my world's a faded pastel  
      C       D#9     Fm5-/7  C  
Well, I guess I'm luckier than some folks   
C        D#9           Dm7     G7  
I've known the thrill of loving you  
 C         Fm       C      C6     Fm5-/7  
And that alone is more than I was created for  
    C     Dm7   G7   C  
'Cause I was born to be blue 

  C      D#9
