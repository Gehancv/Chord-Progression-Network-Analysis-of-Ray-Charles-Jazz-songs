Ray Charles - The Man I Love (Keyboard chords)
( Ira Gershwin and George Gershwin)

 
Introdução: C G7 G7  C Ddim  Em  G7 

 C      C6   C7   Cm    Cm6    Cm7 
Someday he'll come along, the man I love 
Gm        G9      Gm    A#dim       A7  
And he'll be big and strong, the man I love 
F7M           Ddim 
And when he comes my way 
G7       G4/7    G7  C  Ddim  Em G7 
I'll do my best to make him stay 
C          C6     C7   Cm   Cm6         Cm7 
He'll look at me and smile, I'll understand 
Gm       G9       Gm  A#dim            A7  
And in a little while,   he'll take my hand 
F7M              Ddim 
And though it seems absurd 
G7     G4/7     G7    C  F C   F7 E7  
I know we both  won't say a word 
Bridge 
Am       Am5-/7     A#     C7 
Maybe I shall meet him Sunday 
Fdim  Am   Am7   E7 
Maybe Monday, maybe not 
Am             Am7     D7 
Still I'm sure to meet him one day 
Fdim Am     A#dim    F     G7 
Maybe Tuesday will be my good news day 
C         C6      C7   Cm     Cm6       Cm7 
He'll build a little home, just meant for two 
Gm           G9   Gm  A#dim            A7  
From which I'll never roam  who would,  would you 
F7M              Ddim 
And so all else above 
G7      Dm7    G7   C  F6  C 
I'm waiting for the man I love 

  C      G7     Ddim   Em     C6     C7   
                              
                              
                              
                              
                              


  Cm     Cm6    Cm7    Gm     G9     A#dim
                              
                              
                              
                              
                              


  A7     F7M    G4/7   F      F7     E7
