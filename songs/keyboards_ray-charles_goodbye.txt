Ray Charles - Goodbye (Keyboard chords)
(John Lennon and Paul McCartney)

 

C                           Em 
Please don't wake me up too late 
  Am                F     Dm7     G7 
Tomorrow comes and I will not be late 
C                    Em       Am 
Late today when it becomes tomorrow 
       F         G7   C  Dm7  
I will leave and go away 
G7                             F/G 
Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye 
G7                             F/G 
Goodbye. Goodbye. My love, goodbye 
C                       Em 
Songs that linger on my lips 
  Am                 F     Dm7   G7 
Excite me now and linger on my mind 
C                         Em     Am 
Leave your flowers at my door I leave them for 
     F         G7    C  Dm7  
The one who waits behind 
G7                             F/G 
Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye 
G7                             F/G 
Goodbye. Goodbye. My love, goodbye

Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye 
G7                             F/G 
Goodbye. Goodbye. My love, goodbye 
C                  Em 
Far away my lover sings 
     Am            F       Dm7    G7 C G7 
A lonely song and calls me to his side 
 C                     Em       Am 
When a song of lonely love invites me on 
   F      G7      C 
I must go to his side 
G7                             F/G 
Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye 
G7                             F/G 
Goodbye. Goodbye. My love, goodbye 
G7                       F/G   C 
Goodbye. Ah, ha, ha, hi. Goodbye 

  C      Em     Am     F      Dm7    G7
