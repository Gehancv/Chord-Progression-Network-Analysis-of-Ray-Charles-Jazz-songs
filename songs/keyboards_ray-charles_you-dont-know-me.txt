Ray Charles - You Don`t Know Me (Keyboard chords)
(Cindy Walker / Eddy Arnold)

             

  C7+  
You give your hand to me  
              C7    
And then you say, "Hello."    
		F  
And I can hardly speak,    
             Fm6  
My heart is beating so.    
	C            A7  
And anyone can tell    
		Dm         G7  
You think you know me well.    
		E7       A7  
Well, you don't know me.    
	Dm             G7   
(no you don't know me)    
   
           C7+  
No you don't know the one    
               C7  
Who dreams of you at night;    
		F   
And longs to kiss your lips    
               Fm6  
And longs to hold you tight    
	C             A7   
Oh I'm just a friend.    
		Dm        G7  
That's all I've ever been.    
		C   
Cause you don't know me.    
	        C7+    C7   
(no you don't know me)    
   
	F		Em		A7   
For I never knew the art of making love,    
	Dm		G		C7+  C5+   
Though my heart aches with love for you.    
	Am6			    Em   
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by.    
	Dm        F	        G    
A chance that you might love me too.    
	G5+  
(love me too)    
   
         C7+   
You give your hand to me,    
             C7  
And then you say, "Goodbye."    
	F   
I watched you walk away,    
           Fm6  
Beside the lucky guy    
	    C              A7   
Oh, you'll never ever know    
	      Dm          G7  
The one who loved you so.    
		C	  C7+   C5+   
Well, you don't know me    
   
	F		Em		A7   
For I never knew the art of making love,    
	Dm		G		C7+  C5+   
Though my heart aches with love for you.    
	Am6			    Em   
Afraid and shy, I let my chance go by.    
	Dm        F	        G    
A chance that you might love me too.    
	G7+  
(love me too)    
   
              C7+ 
You give your hand to me,    
             C7  
And then you say, "Goodbye."

I watched you walk away,    
           Fm6  
Beside the lucky guy    
	    C              A7   
Oh, you'll never ever know    
	  Dm             G7   
The one who loved you so.

Well, you don't know me
