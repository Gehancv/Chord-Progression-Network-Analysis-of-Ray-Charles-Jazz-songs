( Ann Ronell)



  C7M               F6   C7M                F6 
Willow weep for me, willow weep for me

Bend your branches green along the stream that runs to sea 
F6         Fm7    Dm  A5+ Dm7  Dm6   G      C7M     
Listen to my plea, listen willow,    weep for me 
 C7M             F6            C7M                 F6 
Gone my lover's dream, lovely summer's dream 
C7M              Dm             Em               Dm         G7 
Gone and left me here to weep my tears into the stream 
F6        Fm7     Dm  A5+ Dm7   Dm6  G        C7M 
Sad as I can be  hear me, willow,    weep for me 
   Fm            C#     Cm                  C 
Whisper to the wind and say that love has sinned 
   Fm             D#           C#        C7 
Leave my heart a breaking and making a moan 
   Fm          C#    Cm             C7 
Murmur to the night to hide her starry light 
    Fm             D#          C#         G7 
So none will see me sighing and crying all alone 
  C7M               F6  C7M              F6 
Weeping willow tree, weeping sympathy 
C7M                  Dm               Em              Dm      G7 
Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me 
F6              Fm7          Dm    A5+ Dm7 Dm6       G        C7M 
When the shadows fall, bend, oh willow,    and weep for me

Murmur to the night to hide her starry light

So none will see me sighing and crying all alone

Weeping willow tree, weeping sympathy

Bend your branches down along the ground and cover me
