Ray Charles - Dont Put All Your Dreams In One Basket (Keyboard chords)
(Dennis Morgan)


verse 1 

C7  F                       Am    D7 
Now  don't put all your dreams in one basket 
G7 
Don't put all your hope in one heart 
Gm             C7      Gm           C7 
Fie if you discover that she loves another 
F                F#        F     C7 
You'll be licked before you start 
F                      Am        D7 
Now don't put all your dreams in one basket 
G7 
Love is such a fragile thing 
A#                 Bdim 
And if you should break it 
C                  D7 
Are you sure you can take it? 
Gm             C7             F    C7 
How would your heart forget to sing? 

verse 2 

F                       Am       D7 
Don't put all your dreams in one basket 
G7 
Don't upset your applecart 
Gm                      C7    Gm            C7 
She may think she's clever and leave you forever 
F                  F#         F    C7 
Then what will you tell your heart? 
F                   Am       D7 
So don't put your dreams in one basket 
G7 
Best made plans may go astray 
A#            Bdim 
If you play for hard stakes 
C7                D7 
You might play with heartaches 
Gm                C7   F    D7 
Never throw your dreams away 
Gm                   C7 
Never throw your dreams 
F 
awayyy 

  C7     F      Am     D7     G7     Gm
