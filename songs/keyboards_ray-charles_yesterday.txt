Yesterday       
                                  E7            Am  Em7 Ebm7 Dm7 
All my troubles seemed so far away 
            G7                        C                     E7 
Now it looks as though they're here to stay 
       Am   F7      C       G7   
Oh, I believe in yesterday 
C             Bm7 
Suddenly      
                         E7               Am   Em7 Ebm7 Dm7 
I'm not half the man I used to be 
              G7                             C     E7 
There's a shadow hanging over me 
       Am     F7      C       G7      Bm4/7 Bb7/11+      
Oh, yesterday came suddenly. Why    she   
Am       D7             Dm          G7        C      Bm4/7 Bb7/11+      
Had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.  I          said 
Am       D7             Dm          G7              C      Em7 Dm7 G7/13 
Something wrong, now I long for yesterday 
C              Bm7 
Yesterday          
                    E7                           Am    Em7 Ebm7  Dm7 
Love was such an easy game to play 
               G7                 C          E7 
Now I need a place to hide away 
       Am   F7      C       G7  Bm4/7 Bb7/11+      
Oh, I believe in yesterday. Why    she   
Am       D7             Dm          G7        C            
Had to go, I don't know, she wouldn't say.  I said 
Am       D7             Dm          G7               C       
Something wrong, now, I long for yesterday
