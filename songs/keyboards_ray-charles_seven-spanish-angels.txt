He looked down into her brown eyes, 
                          A#7 
and said "Say a prayer for me". 
 
She threw her arms around him, 
                              D# 
whispered "God will keep us free". 
 
They could hear the riders comin', 
 D#7                        G# 
He said "This is my last fight... 
                         D# 
If they take me back to Texas, 
            A#7            D# 
they won't take me back alive. 
 
 
D# 
There were seven Spanish angels, 
                     A#7 
at the altar of the sun. 
 
They were prayin' for the lovers, 
                      D# 
in the valley of the gun. 
 
When the battle stopped and the smoke cleared, 
 D#7                           G# 
there was thunder from the throne, 
                  D# 
And seven spanish angels, 
       A#7           D# 
took another angel home. 
 
 
D# 
She reached down and picked the gun up, 
                        A#7 
that lay smokin in his hand. 
 
She said, "Father please forgive me; 
                           D# 
I can't make it without my man." 
 
And she knew the gun was empty, 
D#7                         G# 
And she knew she couldn't win, 
                            D# 
But her final prayer was answered 
          A#7             D# 
When the rifles fired again.

There were seven Spanish angels,

And seven spanish angels, 
       A#7           D# 
took another angel home.
