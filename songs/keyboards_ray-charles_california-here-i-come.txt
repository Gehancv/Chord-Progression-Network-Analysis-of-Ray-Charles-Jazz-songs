Ray Charles - California Here I Come (Keyboard chords)
(Al Jolson, Bud De Sylva, and Joseph Meyer)


C         C7/13-        F 
California, here I come  
G                     G7/13-         C 
Right back where I started from  
C                D#dim               Ddim             G7 
Where bowers of flowers bloom in the spring  
C             D#dim 
Each morning at dawning  
      Ddim                   G7 
Birdies sing an' everything  
   C            C7/13-                    F 
A sunkist miss said, "Don't be late"  
G                  G7/13-      C 
That's why I can hardly wait  
F       Fm        A7       D7 
Open up that Golden Gate  
     F     G7  G7/13-  C 
California here I  come 

  C
