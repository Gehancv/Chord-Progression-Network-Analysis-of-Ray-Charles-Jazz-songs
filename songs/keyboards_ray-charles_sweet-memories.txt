Ray Charles - Sweet Memories (Keyboard chords)
(M. Newbury)

 
Intro.: C  F  C  F 
 
C                       C7 
My world is like a river      
F                     F F# G 
as dark as it is deep 
G 
Night after night the past slips in 
                    C 
and gathers all my sleep 
C                               C7 
My days are just and endless stream  
F 
of emptiness to me 
                   C 
Filled only by the fleeting  
        G           C    C/B  C/A 
moments of her memories 
 
 
G          C 
Sweet memories 
E        Am 
Sweet memories 
D   C          G        C      C7  
Oh! mm...mm...mm...mm...mm.. 
 
 
F 
She slipped into the silence  
A#                            A#  B  C 
of my dreams again last night 
C 
Wandering from room to room,  
      C7              F 
she's turning on each light 
 
Her laughter spills like river  
         A#                  
from the water to the sea 
              F 
And I'm swept away from sadness 
         C           F    F/E  F/D  C  C/B  C/A   
clinging to her memories 
 
CHORUS
