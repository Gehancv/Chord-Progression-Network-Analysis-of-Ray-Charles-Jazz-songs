Ray Charles - Let it be (Keyboard chords)
(James Paul Mccartney / John Winston Lennon)

  

 C              G        Am         F 
When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me 
C                 G       F          C 
speaking words of wisdom, let it be. 
                  G        Am              F 
And in my hour of darkness she is standing right in front of me, 
C                 G       F          C 
speaking words of wisdom, let it be. 
Chorus -----------------
       Am         G          F          C           G                F          C 
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
End Chorus -------------
 
 
    C           G           Am       F 
And when the broken-hearted people living in the world agree, 
C                G       F          C 
there will be an answer, let it be. 
                       G       Am               F 
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see, 
C                G       F          C 
there will be an answer, let it be. 
Chorus -----------------
       Am         G          F          C              G             F          C 
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, there will be an answer, let it be. 
       Am         G          F          C           G                F          C 
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
End Chorus -------------
 
    C                 G       Am               F 
And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light that shines on me, 
C             G       F      C 
shine until tomorrow, let it be. 
                 G        Am            F 
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me, 
C                 G       F          C 
speaking words of wisdom, let it be. 
Chorus -----------------
       Am         G          F          C              G             F          C 
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, there will be an answer, let it be. 
       Am         G          F          C              G             F          C 
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, there will be an answer, let it be. 
       Am         G          F          C           G                F          C 
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, whisper words of wisdom, let it be.
