Ray Charles - Good Love Gone Bad (Keyboard chords)

I: 

C                   
It's happening so suddenly 
Bm 
it's hurtin' 
Am                  D               G 
Runnin' through our fingers now desertin' 
C 
Built it all on solid ground 
Bm                 Em 
but now it's no so certain 
A 
don't wanna look into your eyes 
D 
and see this good love dies. 

II: 

C                               Bm 
And all the pain and bitterness today 
Am              D            G 
in every single promise we betrayed 
C                         Bm                    Em 
the hurt we never noticed, till it wouldn't go away 
A 
and if you look into my eyes 
     D 
you're gonna end up cryin' 


Chorus -----------------

               G 
Good love gone bad 
G 
now all our dreams are broken, 
C 
closing doors that once were open 
      D                               G 
knowing into our hearts that it's all over 
           Em 
Still deep inside you know you wanna stay 
            A 
but it's so hard to go our separate ways 
            C                          D 
when all the good we had is hurtin' so bad. 
               G 
Good love gone bad 
G 
we stopped believin' 
C 
stopped the wanting and stop the needin' 
       D                          G 
saying to ourselves that it's all over 
           Em 
Still deep inside I know I wanna stay 
            A 
but it's so hard to go our separate ways 
            C               D 
when all the good we had is gone. 
End Chorus -------------


III: 

C 
No good guys or bad guys, 
         Bm 
wrong or right 
Am                   D                G 
Sometimes things are not so black and white 
C   
You hold on till it kills you 
   Bm                  Em 
or you finally see the light 
A            
and when you look into her eyes 
D           
someone is tryin'. 


Chorus -----------------

               G 
Good love gone bad 
G 
now all our dreams are broken, 
C 
closing doors that once were open 
      D                               G 
knowing into our hearts that it's all over 
           Em 
Still deep inside you know you wanna stay 
            A 
but it's so hard to go our separate ways 
        C                      D 
but you can't bring back yesterday 

               A 
Good love gone bad 
A 
we stopped believin' 
D  
stopped the wanting and stop the needin' 
E                                 A 
saying to ourselves that it's all over 
           F#m 
Still deep inside I know I wanna stay 
            B 
but it's so hard to go our separate ways 
             D                         E 
when all the good we had is hurtin' so bad. 

D                               C#m 
No good guys and bad guys after all 
D             E    
all I really know is... 
             A 
I still love you.
