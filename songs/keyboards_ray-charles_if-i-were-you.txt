Fmaj7                    
        If I were you 

Dm7        Csus4        Cmaj7           Am7 
        I’d look the situation over 

Gm7 C7  F                       Em7 
        Wasn't just by accident 

Dm7                             Fmaj7           Cmaj7 
        Our paths were meant to cross eventually 

Gm7 C7 Fmaj7                                        Fm7 
        You said you’ve lost each time you tried to give 

A#7      Em                                     A7 
        Well I don't mean to tell you how to live 

           F            F - Em7 - Dm7 
        But if I were you 

                                Cmaj7 
        I'd fall in love with me 



Gm7 C7 Fmaj7                                         
        Don't get me wrong 

Dm7             Csus4       G7          Cmaj7            
        I don't pretend to know the future 

Am7 Gm7-C7-F                   Em7             
                If you feel it half as much 

Dm7                        Gsus4        Cmaj7 
        As I do when your body touches me 

Gm7 C7             Dm7                Fm7                       Gm7 
        Oooh, ooh, You must know it's worth at least a try 

Em7                                      A7 
        So please don't let the good life pass you by 

             F          F - Em7 - Dm7 
        Girl, if I were you  

                    Csus4       C 
        I'd fall in love with me 




Gm7 C7                  Fmaj7 
        And if you were me 

                 Cm Gm7                         Am7    Cmaj7 
        You'd feel a pounding deep inside you growing stronger 

Gm7 C7          F          E7 
        And through these eyes 

Am7                                D7 
        You’ll see there isn't any reason 

            G 
        To wait 

            Cm G7        
        Any longer 


C7  Fmaj7        
        So take my advice 

Dm7                  Csus4  Gm7     Cmaj7       Am7 Gm7 
        And all the love I have to give you 

C7 Fmaj7                Em7                 
        Odds are this time you just can't miss 

Dm7                             Csus4      Cmaj7 
        What happened in the past is history 

Gm7     C7  Fmaj7 
        Ooohh, what's going on right now 

              Fm7        
        Can't be denied 

A#7 Em7                                 A7 
        And I only want to help you to decide 

             F            F-Em7-Dm7 
        Girl,  if I were you 

                               Cmaj7     
        I'd fall in love with me 

Gm7     C7           Fmaj7        F - Em7 - Dm7 
        Uh uh uh Yeah, if I were you 

                                Cmaj7 
        I'd fall in love with me
