C7      Am7     Dm7       G7 
No one to talk to, all by myself 
C7       E7         F7     Fm       Fm7 
No one to walk with, I'm happy on the shelf

Ain't misbehavin,  I'm saving my love for you

Now it's for certain, the one I love

I'm through with flirtin' it's just you I'm thinkin' of

Bridge 
Am7             F7             D7                        
Like Jack Horner, in the corner

Don't go no where what do I care 
D7        Am7       D7     G7       G#   G7 
Your kisses are worth waiting for, believe me 
C7         Am7        Dm7         G7 
I don't stay out late, don't care to go 
C7      E7           F7       Fm     Fm7 
I'm home about eight, just me and my radio 
 C7      Am7    Dm7       G7         C   F   Fm7 C G7 C6 
Ain't misbehavin', I'm savin' my love for you
