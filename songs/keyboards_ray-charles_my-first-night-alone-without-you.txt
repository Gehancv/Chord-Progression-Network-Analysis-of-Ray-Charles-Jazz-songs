Ray Charles - My First Night Alone Without You (Keyboard chords)


Intro: Am G F G, Am C G D
 

verse 1
 
Am      G       F      G 
There is an aching in my head 
Am      C      G       D  
From the bed I can't get used to 
Am      G       F      G 
It's these little hours in the dark, I dread 
Am      C      G        D              Dm 
As I spend my first night alone without you 

verse 2 

Am      G       F      G 
Honey, half of me has gone away 
       Am       C      G       D  
With all the love I learned to cling to 
     Am         G       F      G 
Tomorrow I'll have to find another way 
   Am           C      G       D               Dm 
To live the rest of my life alone without you 

 
Chorus -----------------
Dm  C           
                     Em  
You taught me how to live 
     F      G     C      Em 
How to be myself and how to give 
F 
Oh, but now it's you 
     Dm         G 
Who's given up on giving 
C      Em              F 
You've lost the thing, no one to teach                   
F                      Em 
You’re changing and now you're out of reach 
Dm      A# 
And my life tonight 
A#              G 
Just don't seem worth living, no, no 
End Chorus -------------


verse 3 

Am      G       F      G 
I’ve been sitting learning how to be 
Am      C      G       D 
Cuz back in school I never liked to 
Am      G       F      G 
It’s just one of those little things I’m gonna need 
Am      C      G       D       Dm       
As I put my life together now without you
