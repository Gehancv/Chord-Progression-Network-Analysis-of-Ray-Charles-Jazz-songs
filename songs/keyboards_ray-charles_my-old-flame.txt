Ray Charles - My Old Flame (Keyboard chords)
(Sam Coslow and Arthur Johnston)



C  Cdim Em5-/7  
My old flame    
 A7   Dm       Dm7        A#7  G7  
I can't even think of his name  
   C        F7   A#7     D#6     
But it's funny, now and then  
   Cdim 
Now my thoughts go flashing back again  
G  D7 Dm5-/7   G7 G7/13-  
To my old flame  
C  Cdim Em5-/7   
My old flame    
 A7  Dm     Dm7        A#7  G7  
My new lovers all seem so tame 
    C        F7   A#7    D#6  
For I haven't met a gent so  
    Cdim  
Magnificent or elegant  
 G7  D7   A#7  
As my old flame  
Bridge  
D#               Dm5-/7     F#m5-/7  
I've met so many who had fascinatin' ways  
  C7           F4/7     F7  
A fascinatin' gaze in their eyes 
A#7        G7  C4  
Some who took me up to the skies 
 D7             G7      F#m5-/7  
But their attempts at love were only imitations of  
C  Cdim Em5-/7     
My old flame   
   A7   Dm    Dm7         A#7   G7  
I can't even think of his name  
   C       F7     A#7    D#6  
But I'll never be the same 
      Cdim 
Until I discover what became  
 Dm F#m5-/7   C  
Of my  old flame 

  C      Cdim
