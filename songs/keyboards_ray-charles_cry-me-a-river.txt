Am9                Am          
Now you say you're lonely    
Dm7          G7            C    E7 
you cry the whole night through 
        A7        Am7/F#                           
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river  
F         E7         Am   E7 
I cried a river over you 
Am9             Am            
Now you say you're sorry    
Dm7         G7   C  E7 
For being so untrue

Bridge  
Am          E7            Dm            E7    
You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head 
    Am      Dm7     E7 
While you never shed a tear 
Am        E7         Dm            E7 
Remember, I remember all that you said  
  Am       Am7+                  
Told me love was too plebian 
Am7          Am6         Bb9      E7 
Told me you were through with me, and 
A9              Am7        
Now you say you love me   
Dm7              G7        C  E7 
Well, just to prove it's true 
    A7        Am7/F#                       
You can cry me a river, cry me a river 
F           E7       Am7 
I cried a river over you
