C            Cm7         Dm7        G7 
She gets too hungry, for dinner at eight 
C             Cm7           Dm7          G7 
She loves the theater, when never come late 
C           C7M     C9           F       Fm 
She'd never bother, with people she'd hate

Won't go to Harlem, in ermine and pearls

Won't dish the dirt, with the rest of those girls

She likes the free, fresh wind in her hair

Life without care she's broke, but it's o'k

Hates California, it's cold and it's damp
