Ray Charles - Ruby (Keyboard chords)
(Mitchell Parish/Heinz Roemheld)

C7/5+  F6   DM7         G#dim    D#7  
They say, Ruby, you're like a dream, 
 
 C7        Am7      DM7    Dm   
Not always what you seem; 
 
       Dm7              GM7     A#6     Gm+7    A#m6 
And though my heart may break when I awake, 
 
          D+   F      Gm7/5-  C7   C7/5+   F   A#dim    C7  
Let it be so,  I only know, Ruby, it's  you. 
 
 
 
C7/5+  F    DM7          G#dim  D#7  
They say, Ruby, you're like a song, 
 
 C7             Am7      DM7    Dm  
You don't know right from wrong. 
 
     Dm7           GM7  A#6            Gm+7    A#m6 
And in your eyes I see heartbreak for me; 
 
               D+    F           Gm7/5-   C7    C7/5+  F  
But from the start, who stole my heart?  Ruby, it's you. 
 
 
 
Bridge: 
 
    A#m               C7/5+     F 
I hear your voice and I must come to you 
 
   A#m                  C7/5+        C7    Gm7/5-    C7 
I have no choice--what else can I do? 
 
 
C7/5+  F    DM7                 G#dim    D#7   
They say, Ruby, you're like a flame; 
 
 C7     Am7      DM7    Dm 
Into my life you came. 
 
      Dm7             GM7    A#6            Gm+7    A#m6 
And though I should beware, still, I don't care. 
 
              D+  F     Gm7/5-    C7  A#m7/5-  F   A#m7   Gm7/5-   C7    F 
You thrill me so, I only know, Ruby,  it's you.
