Ray Charles - Hide Nor Hair (Keyboard chords)
(Percy Mayfield)

             C#7 
Ohhhh, I was lying in the bed with fever 
      F#7                Gº 
And I was, burning up inside 
C#7                    Dº 
My baby walked, in my bedroom 
            D#7             G#7 
And I could hardly open my eyes  

C#7 
She said that she was going to the pawnshop 
F#7              Gº 
Just across the track 
            C#7                        Dº 
She started packing some clothes in a hurry 
             D#7             G#7       C#7 
And then she said she would be right back 

                 C#7 
But I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day, yeah 
                                       Dº  D#7                 G#7 
Well I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since she went away 
    C#7 
I remember so well when she slammed the door 
        F#7                  Gº 
But the girl didn't make it back no more 
             C#7                   G#7               C#7  F#7  G#7 
I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day 

        C#7                             F#7 
Well, I waited for 24 hours, and I was just about to starve to 
Gº 
Death 
          C#7                Dº               D#7 
It didn't look like she was comin' back, so I had to look out for  
  G#7 
Myself 
       C#7                            F#7                       Gº 
Well I called, the police department, to find out what they knew 
            C#7                       Dº                        D#7 
They said, "No, by heck, but we will get her yet", because they was  
            F#7  C#7 
Lookin' for her too 

                  C#7 
Well I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day, yeah 
                                       Dº   D#7                G#7 
Well I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since she went away 
             C#7 
Well I don't know what happened a-cross the track 
      F#7                  Gº 
But I know my baby didn't make it back 
             C#7                   G#7               C#7   
I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day 

( C#7  F#7  Gº  C#7 ) 
( D#7  C#7  F#7  G#7 ) 

       C#7                                  F#7                Gº 
Well I called, my Dr. Foster, and when the girl answered the phone  

C#7            Dº                  D#7                  G#7 
I got a funny feeling, the way she said Dr. Foster had gone 
              C#7                            F#7          Gº 
She said, "He left with a lady patient, about 24 hours ago" 
        C#7                      Dº                    D#7 
I added two and two, and here's what I got: I got I'll never see  
     F#7       C#7 
That girl no more 

                  C#7 
Well I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day, yeah 
                                      Dº  D#7                 G#7 
But I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since she went away 
       C#7 
If Dr. Foster has got her, then I know I'm through 
        F#7                     Gº 
Because he's got medicine and, money too 
             C#7                   G#7               C#7    
I ain't seen hide `nor hair of my baby, since that day 

F#7      C#7 
Whoaah, no 

  C#7    F#7    Gº     Dº     D#7    G#7
