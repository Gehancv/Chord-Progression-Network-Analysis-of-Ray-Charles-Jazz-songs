Ray Charles - It Was A Very Good Year (Keyboard chords)
(Ervin Drake)

 
Introdução: Am A# Am C A# E7 

       Am             A# 
When I was seventeen it was a very good year 
       Am    
It was a very good year  
    C            A# 
For small town girls and soft summer nights 
  A 
We'd hide from the lights 
    G                 A 
On the village green when I was seventeen 
        Am              A# 
When I was twentyone, it was a very good year 
       Am 
It was a very good year 
    C           A# 
For city girls who lived up the stair 
  A 
With perfumed hair  
   G                A 
That came undone, when I was twenty-one 
        Am             A# 
When I was thirty-five it was a very good year 
       Am 
It was a very good year 
   C              A# 
For blue blooded girls of independant means 
   A 
We'd ride in limousines 
       G                       A 
Their chauffeurs would drive when I was thirty-five 
         Am                 A# 
But now the days are short, I'm in the autumn of the year 
     Am 
And now I think of my life 
    C             A# 
As vintage wine from the old kegs  
      A 
From the brim to the dregs 
         G               A 
It poured sweet and clear, it was a very good year 

  Am     A#     C      E7     A      G
