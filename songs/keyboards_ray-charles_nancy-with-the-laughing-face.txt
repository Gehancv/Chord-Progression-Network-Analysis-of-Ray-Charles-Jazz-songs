 A#dim      Dm7               G9 
If I don't see her each day, I miss her 
C                   Bm    D#m 
Gee what a thrill each time I kiss her

Believe me, I've got a case  on  
  Am7     D7      Dm7   G7       
Nancy with the laughing face 
   A#dim      Dm7           G9 
She takes the winter and makes it summer 
C             Bm    D#m 
Summer could take some lessons from her 
Dm           Bm5-/7     E7    
Picture a tomboy in lace that's  
Am         Fm       C   D#7 
Nancy with the laughing face 
    Bm              Am7+ 
Do you ever hear mission bells ringing 
        Am7                D9    D5-/7 
Well, she'll give you the very same glow 
Fm    C                     Dm7  G7 
When she speaks you would think it was singing 
   Am    Am7    D7    Dm7  G7 
Just hear her say, "Hello" 
  A#dim     Dm7             G9 
I swear to goodness, you can't resist her 
C             Bm    D#m 
Sorry for you, she has no sister 
Dm           Bm5-/7  E7   
No one could ever replace     
 Am       Fm       C    D#7 
My Nancy with the laughing face 
  Bm                Am7+ 
What a wonderful treat to come home to 
     Am7              D9    D5-/7 
When the long day has drawn to a close 
 Fm        C              Dm7       G7 
There's the patter of feet to come home to 
 Am Am7   D7   Dm7   G7 
And Nancy gave me those 
A#dim       m7         G9 
Keep Betty Grable, Lamour and Turner 
C            Bm     D#m 
She makes my heart a charcoal burner 
Dm            Bm5-/7  E7  
No one could ever replace   
Am         Fdim     C    F6  C6 
My Nancy with the laughing face 

  A#dim  Dm7    G9     C      Bm     D#m  
                              
                              
                              
                              
                              


  Dm
