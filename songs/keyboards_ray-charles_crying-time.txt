Ray Charles - Crying Time (Keyboard chords)
(, )


Intro: C G7 C7  
  
        C                              G7  
Oh, its cryin' time again your gonna leave me;  
                                     C  
I can see that far away look in your eyes.  
                  C7              F  
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin',  
        C                G7              C  
That it won't be long before it cryin' time.  
  
  
         C                                     G7  
Oh, they say that absence makes the heart grow fonder,  
                                          C  
And that tears are only rain to make love grow  
                            C7            F  
Well, my love for you could never grow no stronger,  
     C            G7            C  
If I live to be a hundred years old.  
  
  
        C                                    G7  
Oh, you say that you found someone you loved better;  
                                           C  
That the way it happened every time before.  
                   C7                 F 
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow,  
C                           G7                 C 
Cryin' time will start when you walk out the door.  
  
  



  C      G7     C7     F
