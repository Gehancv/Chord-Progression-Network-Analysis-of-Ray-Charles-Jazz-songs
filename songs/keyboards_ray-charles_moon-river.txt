Ray Charles - Moon River (Keyboard chords)
(Johnny Mercer and Henry Mancini)


Introdução: C Am F C 

 C   Am    F            C 
Moon River wider than a mile 
     F         C      Dm    G 
I'm crossing you in style someday 
    C   Em       F     Em 
Oh, dream maker, you heartbreaker 
   Am         D     Em       F   G 
Wherever you're going I'm going your way 
 C   Am       F          C 
Two drifters off to see the world 
      F         C       Dm   G 
There's such a lot of world to see 
    C           Am     F   C 
We're after the samerainbows end 
 F              C 
And waiting round the bend 
F          C      Am   F    G         C 
My huckleberry friend Moon River and me
