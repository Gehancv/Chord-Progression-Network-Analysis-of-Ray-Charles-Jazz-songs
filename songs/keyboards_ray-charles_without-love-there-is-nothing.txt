Ray Charles - Without Love There Is Nothing (Keyboard chords)
(Cole Porter)




C                             F              C 
I awakened this morning I was filled with despair 
                        Am        D7      G7 
All my dreams turned to ashes and gone oh yeah 
C                             F          C 
As I looked at my life it was barren and bare 
                   G7         C 
Without love I've had nothing at all   

                            F          C 
Once I had a sweetheart who loved only me 
                          Am            D7       G7 
There was nothing oh that she would not give  oh no 
C                                   F           C 
But I was blind to her goodness and I could not see 
                     G7          C 
That a heart without love cannot live 

      G7             C 
Without love  I've had nothing 
        F             D7         G7 
Without love I've had nothing at all 
       C                           F 
I have conquered the world all but one thing did I have 
        C             G7         C 
Without love I've had nothing at all 

  C      F      Am     D7     G7
