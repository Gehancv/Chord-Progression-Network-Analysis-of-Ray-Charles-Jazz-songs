Ray Charles - Here We Go Again (Keyboard chords)

Capo: 3 

C7       F 
Here we go again 
F7            A# 
She's back in town again 
G7            C  
I'll take her back again 
C7       F  
One more time 

C7       F 
Here we go again 
F7             A# 
The phone will ring again 
G7          C 
I'll be her fool again 
C7       F 
One more time 

A#                   
 I've been there before 
         F 
And I'll try it again 
G7 
But any fool knows 
             C         C7 
That there's no way to win 

         F 
Here we go again 
F7              A# 
She'll break my heart again 
G7            C 
I'll play the part again 
G7  C7   F 
One more time 

  C7     F      F7     A#     G7     C
