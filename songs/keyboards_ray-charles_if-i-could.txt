I'd protect you from the sadness in your eyes 
          A7                         Dm

If I could

Yes, I would

      Am 
If I could

I would try to shield your innocence from time 
        Em                          F#m7 
But the part of life I gave you isn't mine 
                  B7             Em  Emmaj7  Em7 G7 
I've watched you grow, so I could let -  you  -  go

I would help you make it through the hungry years 
       A7                               Dm

If I could 

Chorus -----------------
 
           Am 
Yes, If I live

In a time and place where you don't want to be 
          Em                              F#m7 
You don't have to walk along this road with me

My yesterday won't have to be  -  your  -  way

Verse 
      D 
If I knew 
        F#m                                  Am 
I would try to change the world I brought you to 
              B7                 Em 
And there isn't very much that I could do 
       A 
But I would 
      G 
If I could 
Oh baby 
 F#m7 
Daddy wants to protect you 
    Em7                           A 
And help my baby through the hungriest 
Cos you're part of me 
           G 
And if you ever ever need 
        F#m7 
Said a shoulder to cry on 
   Em7 
Or just someone to talk to 
         A 
I'll be there, I'll be there 
          G        F#m7 
I didn't change your world 
      Em7  A 
But I would 
      D 
If I could 

  C      Em     Gm     A7     Dm     G    
                              
                              
                              
                              
                              


  Am     D      F#m7   B7
