Ray Charles - Your Cheatin` Heart (Keyboard chords)

C				    F 
Your cheatin' heart will make you weep 
	G			C       F G 
You'll cry and cry and try to sleep 
C				              F 
but sleep won't come the whole night through 
	G			C       F C7 
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you 
 
		F		      C 
When tears come down like fallin' rain 
F				G 
you'll toss around and call my name 
C				             F 
You're gonna walk that floor the way I do 
	G			C       F C7 
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you 
 
		F		      C 
When tears come down like fallin' rain 
F				G 
you'll toss around and call my name 
C				             F 
You're gonna walk that floor the way I do 
	G			C       F C7 
Your cheatin' heart will tell on you
