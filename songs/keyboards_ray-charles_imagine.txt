verse 1

Imagine there's no Heaven 
C                F7 
It's easy if you try

No hell below us

Above us only sky

Living, living, living for today

Imagine there's no countries 
C                F7 
It isn't hard to do 
C                  F7 
Nothing to kill or die for 
C               F7 
And no religion too

Living, living, living life in peace

F        G             C

Imagine no possessions 
C               F7 
I wonder if you can

No need for greed or hunger 
C                F7 
A brotherhood of man 
F7              Dm 
Imagine all the people 
G        C         Dm             G 
Sharing, sharing, sharing all the world
