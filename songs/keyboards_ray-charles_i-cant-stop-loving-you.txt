Ray Charles - I Can't Stop Loving You (Keyboard chords)
(Billy Nicholls)

   	     C                    F                                            C  
1.     	I can`t stop loving you, I`ve made up my mind,  
                                    G                                        C      C7  
                     to live in memory of the lonesome time.  
                          F                                             C  
  	I can`t stop wanting you, it`s useless to say,  
                        G                    G7                         C   F   C  
   	so I`ll just live my life in dreams of yesterday.  
  
                               C       C7                         F  
2.	Those happy hours         that we once knew,  
                            C                                      G     G7  
    	though long ago, they still make me blue.  
                               C    C7                             F  
  	They say that time     heals the broken heart,  
                                        C     G            G7                 C     C7  
    	but time has stood still      since we`ve been apart.
