Ray Charles - Bewitched, Bothered And Bewildered (Keyboard chords)
(Lorenz Hart and  Richard Rodgers)


Introdução: C D7 G7 Dm7 G7 

    C       Gdim  Dm7       Cdim 
I'm wild again,  beguiled again 
  C      E7    F7M        Fdim 
A simpering, whimpering child again 
  C    D7         G7      Dm7 G7 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I 
C          Gdim   Dm7         Cdim 
Couldn't sleep, and wouldn't sleep 
   C        E7     F7M           Fdim 
When love came and told me I shouldn't sleep  
  C    D7     G7    C7M     F7M A7 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

She is cold, I agree 
Dm              G7 
She can laugh, but I love it

Although the laugh's on me 
     C        Gdim   Dm           Cdim 
I'll sing to her,  each spring to her 
    C      E7        F7M         Fdim 
And long for the day when I'll cling to her 
  C    D7      Dm7    G7      C  C/B  A7 Gdim 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I

Although the laugh's on me 
     C        Gdim   Dm           Cdim 
I'll sing to her,  each spring to her 
    C      E7        F7M         Fdim 
And long for the day when I'll cling to her 
  C    D7      Dm7    G7     C   C/B  A7 Gdim 
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered am I
