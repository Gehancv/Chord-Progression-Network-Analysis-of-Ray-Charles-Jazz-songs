Ray Charles - Hallelujah, I love her so (Keyboard chords)
(Ray Charles)

G       G7                C    D7  
Let me tell you about a girl I know,   

G       G7                C    D7  
She's my baby and she loves me so.  
  
G       G7                C    D7  
Every morning when the sun comes up,   
  
G             G7            C       D7  
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup.   
  
G                        A#dim 
That's why I know, yes I know,   
  
G              
Hallelujah I just love her so.   
  
  
     C6      C       C9    F9      G#dim  
When I'm in trouble and I have no friends,  
  
  C6           C      C9    F9    G#dim  
I know she'll go with me until the end.  
  
C          C9      C7           F9  
Ev'rybody asks me how I know.  
  
   F6                          D#dim  
I smile at them and say, "She told me so."  
  
       G#dim   C    Cmaj7  A7  
That's why I know, oh, I know,  
  
     F9            G7       C    C9   C  
Hallelujah, I just love her so.  
  
  
  
Bridge:  
  
F          F9            Fm6   G#dim         
Now, if I call her on the telephone,   
  
C    C6        C      C9    C  
And tell her that I'm all alone.  
  
F       F9               Fm6    Dm7/5-  
By the time I count from one to four,   
  
 F9       Dm7      Dm7/5-    G7  
She'll be knocking  on  my door.   
  
  
C6      C       C9      F9      G#dim  
In the evening when the sun goes down   
  
 C6        C    C9   F9   G#dim  
When there is nobody else around,   
  
    C          C9      C7             F9  
She kisses me and she holds me tight.   
  
     F6                   D#dim  
And tells me, "Daddy everything's alright."  
  
       G#dim   C    Cmaj7  A7  
That's why I know, yes, I know,  
  
     F9             G7      C    C9   C  
Hallelujah, I just love her so.
