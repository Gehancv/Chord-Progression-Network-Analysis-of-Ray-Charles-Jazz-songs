Ray Charles - Leave My Woman Alone (Keyboard chords)
(Ray Charles)


C 
If you don't want you don't have to get into trouble 
       F                            C 
If you don't want you don't have to get into trouble 
        
If you don't want you don't have to get into trouble 
         F              C 
You just leave my woman alone 

       F        C 
Well I know you are a playboy 
    F                         G7 
And you've got women all over town 
       F                    C 
But if I ever see you sweet talk my little girl 
          D#7          C 
I'm gonna lay you body down 

Repeat #1  But if you… 

       F           C 
Well I know you've got some money 
    F                 G7 
And you got a new '57 too 
       F                    C 
But if I ever see my little girl in your new car 
               D#7          C 
I'm a gonna do some work on you 

Repeat #1  But if you… 
  
       F                C 
Well I don't believe in trouble 
      F                     G7 
And I don't want to start a fight 
       F                           C 
But if you take heed and stay away from my little girl 
           D#7       C 
Everything will be alright 

  C      F      G7     D#7
