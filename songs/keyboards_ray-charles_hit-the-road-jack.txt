End Chorus -------------
  
    
(Repeat chorus)  
   
   
Am         G                  F          E   
Oh, woman, oh, woman, oh you treat me so mean!  
            Am          G            F         E   
You're the meanest old woman that I ever have seen.   
         Am      G       F     E   
Well I guess if you say so   
     Am       G        F         E   
I'll have to pack my things and go.   

(Chorus)  

    Am            G               F               E   
Now Baby, listen Baby, don't you treat me this-a way   
        Am      G           F       E   
'Cause I'll be back on my feet someday.   
      Am           G             F       E   
Don't care if you do, cause it's understood,   
      Am     G                    F       E   
You  got no money, and you just ain't no good.   
        Am       G       F   E   
Well I guess if you say so    
     Am       G         F       E   
I'll have to pack my things and go.   

   
Chorus    



  Am     G      F      E
