# Chord-Progression-Network-Analysis-of-Ray-Charles-Jazz-songs

In this project, we constructed a chord progression network based on chords extracted from Ray Charles songs in the website: https://www.e-chords.com/ray-charles. The nodes are the chords and the links connecting the chords of the song in an orderly fashion. For each pair of nodes, there is a source chord and a target chord, it is a directed and weighted graph, and the weight indicates in how many songs the transition occurred. The network has 167 nodes and 1246 edges. All the chords were transposed to the keys Major C and to it’s relative Am, in order to preserve similarities in distances among all the songs.

The inspiration behind the project was to analyze basic musical concepts like orders between notes (Scales and the Circle of Fifths) that lend themselves well to graph representations. This project aims to generate complex graphs for songs and seeks to clarify which patterns music follows, what structural characteristics it has, and how these structures influence the songs of Ray Charles, an influential musician in Soul and Jazz.

Research Questions: 

a.	Nodes and link attacks could represent failures in the instrument or the person playing it. Can the chord progression network show why some mistakes in songs go unnoticed? What is the robustness of the network?
b.	Does Ray Charles have a unique music style compared to other artists?
c.	In the structure, why do more important links (larger weights) appear? 
d.	Does Ray Charles prefer chords used in his songs?
e.	Are there any communities? Is there homophily? Is it possible to explain those communities using music theory?
	
In summary, these questions cover a range of topics related to the uniqueness of Ray Charles’s songs and network attributes such as communities, homophily, robustness, the prominence of high-weighted links, and the appearance of hubs.
